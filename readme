I'm making another operating system kernel

    - booted with the GRUB2 bootloader
    - runs on i686 (x86-32) architecture
    - doesn't do a lot really

I've made two kernels in the past but every time I make one I learn things, so
here's another. Plus, I'm learning assembly at university, so this seems like a
good project to help with learning that. I'm planning on writing the majority
of the kernel, and maybe even the userland, in assembly, just cause that would
be really cool, but we'll see.
