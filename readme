** octOs **

I'm making another operating system kernel.

    - booted with the GRUB2 bootloader.
    - runs on i686 (x86-32) architecture.
    - doesn't do a lot really.

I've made two kernels in the past but every time I make one I learn things, so
here's another. Plus, I'm learning assembly at university, so this seems like a
good project to help with learning that. I'm planning on writing the majority
of the kernel, and maybe even the userland, in assembly, just cause that would
be really cool, but we'll see.

* Build Instructions *

You need the following software:

    REQUIRED
    - An i686 gcc cross-compiler. (e.g. i686-elf-gcc) (to compile C source files for the CPU)
    - grub. (to generate the grub image)
    - nasm. (to assemble the assembly source files)
    - i686-elf-binutils.
    
    OPTIONAL
    - bochs (for emulating the kernel before testing on real hardware)

 Once you have all of this software, the build steps are:

    1) Clone this repository.
    2) cd into the repo directory.
    3) type make.

And then it should all compile successfully. If you want to emulate it, type `bochs`.
If you want to try running it on real hardware (not recommended yet), burn octos.iso
to a USB stick or CD-ROM and tell your BIOS to boot from it.
